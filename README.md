# Vitaliks-Place
Vitalik's Place is a big shared canvas on Ethereum made up out of 1000x1000 pixels. Do you feel lucky? If you paint the lucky pixel you WIN the jackpot! 
Below, a small introduction to the project is given. For more in-depth information please refer to the documentation.

Vitalik's Place is a massive online shared canvas on the Ethereum blockchain consisting of 1 million pixels, with some of them holding Ethereum. When you are lucky and draw the right pixel, you earn the jackpot that consists of a certain amount of ether! The more pixels are drawn over time, the bigger the jackpot gets! The project is heavily inspired by Reddit's Place, the Million Dollar Webpage and especially Satoshi's Place. This documentation is written to explain all components of the system for those interested. Although all being publicly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, this documentation also explains, justifies and analyses the mechanisms that are involved in the random process of picking winners and prizes.
